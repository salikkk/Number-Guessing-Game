# Number-Guessing-Game
This is my second C project. a Number Guessing Game where the player tries to guess a random number generated by the computer.

The computer generates a random number between **1 to 100**, and the user has to guess it.  
After each guess, the program tells whether your guess is **Too High** or **Too Low**.

## 🧠 How the game works

1. The program picks a **random number** between **1 and 100**.
2. You must enter your guess.
3. The program gives hints:
   - **Too High** → Your guess is greater than the secret number  
   - **Too Low** → Your guess is smaller than the secret number  
4. You continue guessing until you get the correct answer.
